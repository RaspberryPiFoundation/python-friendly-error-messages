# Demo

This directory contains a demo HTML file that showcases the Python Friendly Error Messages library.

The demo shows how the library transforms common Python error traces (from both Skulpt and Pyodide runtimes) into friendly, beginner-friendly explanations. It includes examples of:

- **NameError**: Undefined variables
- **SyntaxError**: Missing colons and syntax issues
- **AttributeError**: Wrong method names (e.g., `.push()` instead of `.append()`)
- **TypeError**: Type mismatches
- **UnboundLocalError**: Variables used before assignment
- **IndexError**: List index out of range
- **KeyError**: Dictionary key not found
- **ZeroDivisionError**: Division by zero

Each example shows:
1. The original Python traceback
2. The code that caused the error
3. The friendly explanation generated by the library

## Usage

1. Make sure the project is built:
   ```bash
   npm run build:all
   ```

2. Open `index.html` in a web browser. You can:
   - Simply open the file directly in your browser
   - Or use a local web server (recommended) by executing the following command in the root directory of the project:
     ```bash
     # Using Python
     python -m http.server 8000
     
     # Using NodeJS
     npx http-server -p 8000
     ```
     Then navigate to `http://localhost:8000/demo/`
