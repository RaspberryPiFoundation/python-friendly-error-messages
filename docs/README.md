## Hosted demo

https://raspberrypifoundation.github.io/python-friendly-error-messages/

This directory contains a demo `index.html` file that showcases the Python Friendly Error Messages library. This uses a given build of the library.

The demo shows how the library transforms common Python error traces (from both Skulpt and Pyodide runtimes) into friendly, beginner-friendly explanations. It includes examples of:

- **NameError**: Undefined variables
- **SyntaxError**: Missing colons and syntax issues
- **AttributeError**: Wrong method names (e.g., `.push()` instead of `.append()`)
- **TypeError**: Type mismatches
- **UnboundLocalError**: Variables used before assignment
- **IndexError**: List index out of range
- **KeyError**: Dictionary key not found
- **ZeroDivisionError**: Division by zero

Each example shows:
1. The original Python traceback
2. The code that caused the error
3. The friendly explanation generated by the library

### Usage

This is [handled automatically](../.github/workflows/pages.yml) on the hosted demo, but to run it locally against a specific version of the library:

Set the version of the library in `docs/package.json`, then in this `docs/` directory run:

1. Install the package and prepare the demo:
   ```bash
   npm install
   npm run prepare-demo
   ```

Then in the root directory of the project:

1. Start up a local web server:
   ```bash
   npx http-server -p 8000
   ```

2. Navigate to `http://localhost:8000/docs/local-demo.html`


## Local demo

The `local-demo.html` file in this directory is a copy of the hosted demo that can be run locally, ie. against the local build of the library. Useful for development and testing.

### Usage

(all commands should be run in the root directory of the project)

1. Make sure the project is built:
   ```bash
   npm run build:all
   ```

2. Start up a local web server:
   ```bash
   npx http-server -p 8000
   ```

3. Navigate to `http://localhost:8000/docs/local-demo.html`
